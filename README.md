*If you are seeing this, this website is currently under construction.*

A website covering Taito's *Battle Gear* series (including *Side by Side*) of coin-op racing games.

In creating this website, I would give special thanks to the following who inspired me for this website:
* Taito Corporation, for the games *and* keeping the [*Battle Gear* official website online](https://battlegear.net/news/index.html) for time being, [complete with archived sites for past *Battle Gear* games](https://battlegear.net/archives/index.html)
* [mokonaXVI](https://mokonaxvi.sakura.ne.jp/) ([on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mokonaXVI) / [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@mokonaXVI))
* [pooka11509574](https://twitter.com/pooka11509574)
* [derole, for the NESYS Revival Project](https://nrproject.derole.co.uk/)
* [goilup](https://goilup.blogspot.com/2024/06/battle-gear-3-north-america.html), for dumping the US English version of *Battle Gear 3*
* [Anjasmara Putranto](https://www.youtube.com/@anjasmaraputranto7818), for footage of English version of the first *Battle Gear* prior to mokonaXVI's acquisition of BG1 board.
* [A.S HORNET](https://www.youtube.com/@a.shornet0808), for footage of [*Battle Gear 2V*.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr6Fl5fIdj0mq1Y64bzBlO2x5Tg-zKsQj)
* [Agarin Pachi](https://www.youtube.com/@agarpac), an Indonesian vtuber who runs a Discord server with a channel for Indonesian arcade discussion.
* MAME team, for notes present in the [Taito JC System,](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/mame/taito/taitojc.cpp) [Taito Type-Zero,](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/mame/taito/taitotz.cpp) and [Namco System 2x6](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/mame/namco/namcops2.cpp) hardware drivers
* Every Indonesian arcade that keeps their *Side by Side*/*Battle Gear* cabinets running. Big thanks in particular to Timezone Istana Plaza (Bandung), for keeping their English *Battle Gear 3* cabinet running (as of December 2024; moved from Bandung Indah Plaza/BIP in mid-2024) and various Sky Games (a low-to-mid tier arcade chain) locations for having at least one Taito racer in every of their arcade that I went.
* Various people in the retro racing game community, especially the Japanese arcade-goers.
* The people in the *Tokyo Xtreme Racer*/*Shutokou Battle* Discord server, as I originally noted most of the stuff there.
