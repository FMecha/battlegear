# battlegear

A website covering Taito's *Battle Gear* series (including *Side by Side*) of coin-op racing games.

In creating this website, I would give special thanks to the following who inspired me for this website:
- Taito Corporation, for the games *and* keeping the [*Battle Gear* official website online](https://battlegear.net/news/index.html) for time being, [complete with archived sites for past *Battle Gear* games](https://battlegear.net/archives/index.html)
- [mokonaXVI](https://mokonaxvi.sakura.ne.jp/) ([on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mokonaXVI) / [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@mokonaXVI))
- [pooka11509574](https://twitter.com/pooka11509574)
- [derole, for the NESYS Revival Project](https://nrproject.derole.co.uk/)

- Every Indonesian arcade that keeps their *Side by Side*/*Battle Gear* cabinets running. Big thanks in particular to Timezone Istana Plaza (Bandung), for keeping their English *Battle Gear 3* cabinet running (as of May 2025; moved from Bandung Indah Plaza/BIP in mid-2024) and various Sky Games (a low-to-mid tier arcade chain) locations for having at least one Taito racer in every of their arcade that I went.
- Various people in the retro racing game community, especially the Japanese arcade-goers.

- [Nenkai's GT Modding Hub,](http://nenkai.github.io/gt-modding-hub/) which serves as a major influence/inspiration on this website's design and style.
