Pages relating to *Side by Side* titles, the first part in Taito's coin-op touge racing series. All arcade games in this series run on the [Taito JC System hardware.](https://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=667)

!!! note
- The arcade *Side by Side* titles does not support coinage to be set to free play. (Not currently sure if other Taito JC System games have a similar limitation.)
- **For emulator users:** If you are emulating any Taito JC System game in MAME, you should be running version 0.266 with `-cheat` switch and overclock the `maincpu`, `sub`, and `dsp` CPUs to at least 200%. [See the comparison with and without overclocking.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCzgSLNob-8&t=13s) Currently, Taito JC games suffer from a slowdown due to imperfect CPU emulation. [Starting from version 0.267,](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/commit/3d357c07c0ca824868bbe7586839c8caae236571#diff-2fc8ed920c6dc8de6019a9cde02d47e52e622912f49e6e03a5544471103b32d4) changes in Motorola 68000 FPU emulation has made the performance worse, even overclocked.

!!! warning 
    For the first *Side by Side* in particular, if you win a race with overclocked CPU as mentioned above, [MAME can also crash](https://mametesters.org/view.php?id=8852) if you reach the Congratulations screen. This is not an issue with *Side by Side 2.*
