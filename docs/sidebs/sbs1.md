*"No way to let him get ahead of me!"*

The first game in the series, [released in July 1996 in Japan,](https://archive.org/details/ArcadeGameList1971-2005/page/n46/mode/1up?view=theater) with the 2005 edition of *Domestic and Overseas Arcade Game List* [reporting an US release the month prior](https://archive.org/details/ArcadeGameList1971-2005/page/n138/mode/1up?view=theater) - which, if it did saw release there, appeared to be one of the company's few last releases before their American operations shuttered around the same year. (Taito USA's address is still listed in the game's flyer, coincidentally.)

!!! note 
    If you are emulating any Taito JC System game in MAME, you should be running version 0.266 with `-cheat` switch and set the CPU overclock to at least 200%. [Properly overclocked, it should run like this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY-vNodNSN0) Currently, Taito JC games suffer from a slowdown due to imperfect CPU emulation. [Starting from version 0.267,](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/commit/3d357c07c0ca824868bbe7586839c8caae236571#diff-2fc8ed920c6dc8de6019a9cde02d47e52e622912f49e6e03a5544471103b32d4) changes in Motorola 68000 FPU emulation has made the performance worse, even overclocked.

!!! warning 
    For the first *Side by Side* in particular, if you win a race with overclocked CPU as mentioned above, [MAME can also crash](https://mametesters.org/view.php?id=8852) if you reach the Congratulations screen.
