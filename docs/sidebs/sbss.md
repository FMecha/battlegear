An extended port of *Side by Side 2* for the original PlayStation with cars and tracks from the first *Side by Side* also thrown in. Originally released in December 1997 only in Japan, with a re-release version called *Side by Side Special 2000* (referring to then-forthcoming year of 2000 and its discounted price of 2,000 yen) releasing in late 1999. (The *Arkanoid Returns* port for the same console also received a similar treatment, named *Arkanoid R 2000*.)

## Builds

This game and its arcade counterpart, *Side by Side 2*, appears to be developed simultaneously, as an mistake caught [in an flyer for *Side by Side 2*](../../images/etc/sbs2_flyer.jpg) was present here and never fixed in *Special 2000*.

Product Code | Build Date | Release Date | Title | Notes
------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------
`SLPM-80145` | 1997-08-23 | 1997-??-?? | *Side by Side Special Taikenban* | Demo version limited to three cars and two tracks. [TCRF page](https://tcrf.net/Proto:Side_by_Side_Special#Taikenban_Disc)
`SLPS-01150` | 1997-10-30 | 1997-12-18 | *Densha de GO!* | Demo version present in *Densha de GO!*'s Omake menu. Built ten hours *before* the 1997 retail version, judging by its executable (`SBS\SLPS-011.75`). Same as the standalone demo disc but with assets from the final game. _Product code here refers to main *Densha de GO!* disc._ [TCRF page](https://tcrf.net/Proto:Side_by_Side_Special#Densha_de_GO.21_Demo)
`SLPS-01175` | 1997-10-30 | 1997-12-04 | *Side by Side Special* | Initial retail release.
