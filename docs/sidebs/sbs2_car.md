# Side by Side 2 Cars

The following are cars available in [*Side by Side 2 Evoluzione*.](../sidebs/sbs2.md) Twelve cars from Japan's major automakers are featured; note that the [Honda cars are disabled in the US (region `A`) version of the game.](../other/honda.md)

Spec data in *italics* are what the in-game cars' true specifications [according to the developers.](https://web.archive.org/web/19971012081536/http://www.taito.co.jp/sbs2/spec.htm) (Because the full car logos were not waybacked, the order on specs on the website goes R32, FD3S, FC3S, RPS13, EG6/EF8, AE86s, GC8, CN9A, and ends at ST205. It is not clear if the AE86 specifications is for the Trueno only, or also for the Levin, due to missing images, although the developers did mention that the ride quality of both cars are exactly the same.)

## CPU-Only Cars 

#### Subaru GF8 Impreza WRX STi Station Wagon Version III
![SUBARU GF8 IMPREZA WRX STi STATION WAGON VERSION III](/images/cars/sbs2/sidebs2_gf8_com.png)

A car that only appears as an opponent in April and March tracks, and not selectable by the player. Note that the regularly playable, sedan version of Impreza does not appear as an opponent. Why is this car here in this state is unknown. It is defenitely *not simply* the Impreza texture applied to the Legacy wagon, as this car has different roof rails and spoiler modeling.

In *Side by Side Special*, the opponent in the aforementioned tracks are replaced with the playable sedan model.

#### Special/22:00 Course Tuned Cars
For the 22:00 (Special) course, the opponent cars have further tuning to emphasize the increased difficulty, [according to the developers.](https://web.archive.org/web/19971012101858/http://www.taito.co.jp/sbs2/com_spec.htm) (Due to missing logo images, the order goes BNR32, FD3S, FC3S, RPS13, EG6, AE86s, GC8, and CN9A.) These cars also have close-ratio six-speed transmission except for the Civic, which keeps a five-speed (but also close-ratio) gearbox; the playable AE86s would later be converted to six-speed in *Evoluzione RR* update.

Some of these cars also have different rims to distinguish:

* The FC RX-7 gains the 8-spoke RS Watanabe wheel as used in the Trueno.
* The FD RX-7 gains the mesh wheel as used in the FC RX-7.
* The EG Civic gains a white 5-spoke wheel as used in the previous *Side by Side* game.
* The R32 GT-R gains a black 5-spoke wheel as used in the FD RX-7 in the first *Side by Side*.
* The 180SX gains the silver/gold mesh wheel as used in the AE86 Levin.
* The AE86 Levin gains a unique steel wheel not used in any other car in either games.

    * Both the FD and FC are listed with the same engine tuning, so they are here together.
    * It is not clear if the NA 20B used is a detuned Mazda 787 Group C engine, or Eunos Cosmo's engine with turbo removed (as the 20B-REW on the Eunos Cosmo was turbo only).
