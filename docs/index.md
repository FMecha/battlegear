**Welcome to the Side by Side and Battle Gear Archive website!** This website aims as a documentation of everything relating to Taito's coin-op touge racing series in English.

This website, currently in soft launch (as such, many pages are not yet available) is in constant work in progress as new information becomes available. You can help by visting [the website's repository,](https://github.com/FMecha/battlegear) either by making pull requests or [using the discussions feature.](https://github.com/FMecha/battlegear/discussions) Or you could contact me on Twitter (@fmecha_exe) or on Discord (fmecha).
