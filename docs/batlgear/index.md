# Battle Gear Series

Pages relating to *Battle Gear* titles, the second part in Taito's coin-op touge racing series. 

* The first two games in the series run on the [Taito Type-Zero hardware,](https://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=673) Taito's last bespoke, in-house arcade hardware (i.e. not derived on console technology or an embedded PC). MAME documents its hardware, but it is not considered as working, and its sound chip has yet to be dumped.
* *Battle Gear 3* and it's *Tuned* update runs on the Namco System 246 hardware, based on the PlayStation 2. The Play! emulator will boot them, but in very preliminary state.
* *Battle Gear 4* and it's *Tuned* update runs on Taito Type X+ hardware, which is an Windows XP Embedded system.
